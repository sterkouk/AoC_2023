Explanation for solution 3


I create 2 dictionairies one with the containing numbers and one with the special characters
The key of the dictionairies are the coordinates and the values are the numbers or the characters

BuildNumbers method:

This method takes an array of strings (inputLines) and processes it to extract numerical values and their corresponding coordinates.
It uses a nested loop to iterate through each character in each line of the input.
If a digit (excluding '.') is encountered, it starts collecting digits until a non-digit character is found. It then converts the collected digits into an integer.
The coordinates (row and column) and the corresponding integer value are stored in a dictionary.

BuildSpecialCharacters method:

Similar to BuildNumbers, this method processes the input to extract special characters (non-digit and non-'.') and their coordinates.
It iterates through each character in each line of the input and stores the coordinates and characters in a dictionary.

GetNumberCoordinates method:

Given a coordinate and a dictionary of numbers, this method returns the coordinates that form the number associated with the input coordinate.
It checks if the input coordinate exists in the dictionary. If not, it returns an empty enumerable.
If the coordinate exists, it calculates the number of digits in the associated value and returns a sequence of coordinates accordingly.

NeigbourIsSpecial method:

Given a coordinate and a dictionary of special characters, this method checks if any neighboring coordinates (including diagonals) contain special characters.
It defines an array of neighboring coordinates and iterates through them, checking if each one exists in the dictionary of special characters.

Part1 method:

It takes dictionaries of numbers and special characters as input.
It iterates through each entry in the numbers dictionary, calculates the coordinates forming the number, and checks if any neighboring coordinates contain special characters using the NeigbourIsSpecial method.
If a neighboring coordinate contains a special character, it accumulates the associated number.
Finally, it prints the accumulative value.
